<h2>A guide to LittleFoot</h2>
<p>LittleFoot is a content management system. 
I feel it is different from other CMS software because of how simple everything is. 
I have found that using an MVC structure for my apps makes everything so much easier.</p>


<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>The Dashboard is where you arranage your navigation menu. We can move items up and down as well as change the subdirectory it is in. If you set an item's position to 0, it becomes hidden from the navigation menu. This can be useful for things like a signup page where you would only want to link to it from the login application. Here is the dashboard with a nav item selected.</p>

<p>When you first go the dashboard panel, nothing is selected and you have the option to create a new navigation item.</p>

<p>By default, we have the login app linked to all pages.</p>

<p>Selected navigation items turn blue and surround the child items.</p>

<p>You can use this tool to add apps to the currently selected page. If no item is selected, it gets linked to on all pages globally.</p>
